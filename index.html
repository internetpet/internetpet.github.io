                    hey, petra here. figured i'd write some blurbs for the NS Melee PR that's released. these are all written by myself and meant to be a fun celebration and description of everyone's season. i have a ton of respect for everyone in this community and i'm happy that i get to play them in my favorite game. the PR itself was decided by five panelists below, plus a tiebreaker vote

                    While he spent the first half of 2023 nursing an injury from a biking accident, the goodnight gamer found himself back to his previous level once recovered. He spent the latter half of 2023 mostly placing his seed at events, picking up a win on Quest at Kings of Hali 6 and also playing his matches in pool instead of melee.

                    AJC defines the "Rising Star" tagline and has got there through sheer dedication to this game. The second most active Atlantic Canada player had over 300 sets under his belt in 2021 and doesn't stop there. He's very active offline, helping organize every in person SSBM event in Prince Edward Island for months now, and taking 1st place at three of them.<br><br>

                    In the past few months is when he's got his best wins; on OtES, Glumbo and Asuka. As a mainstay in the 5th-7th range of Slippi Sauce, to me, it feels like it's not if he will figure out what he needs to do to level up, but when?

                    While not primarily playing Melee before the pandemic, Josh made a very good impression when he started to play Melee online or at locals. Being ranked #10 in New Brunswick for SSBU, he took some of the fundamentals from Ultimate and transferred them to Melee. Playing a very good defensive, neutral heavy Sheik along with a mean punish game when landing hits on his opponent. He has always been consistent when it comes to tournament performance and with that he landed wins on Maher, AJC, bae and Joe(y) Bats which will net him a #10 on the Atlantic PR. You will definitely see more of Josh Magbrag in upcoming tournaments killing it with his Sheik and maybe even his Roy.

                    Despite his transition to a TO for the duration of this season, Drizzy has remained solidly second in New Brunswick and competitive with the entire region. Playing three characters is no easy task, but Drizzy's Fox, Marth and Sheik are extremely competitive and cannot be slept on by anyone. Wins on Asuka, Josh Magbrag an undefeated record against non PR places him comfortably in this spot. Stepping back from TOing could certainly see a return to high level competition from Drizzy, so pay attention in the coming season.

                    If this was a ranking of heart and desire, Lil Mitts would easily place first. Known for his crazy rollout tech onto Randall and his passionate pop offs, LilMitts is one of the Jigglypuff mains everyone loves to watch. Undaunted by the wall that is our current ever-improving top 5, Lil Mitts continues to place himself firmly in the conversation, being one the most active and willing to improve entrants of this season's PR. With wins on NSFrog, OtES, ACSL and AwesomeVideoGames, he certainly has the potential to win big sets. Whenever you see him on stream be ready to see some crazy rests and even crazier pop offs.

                    As someone who plays melee simply for their love of the game, you may think that "glumbo"s Fox might tote a more basic, lackadaisical style of play. You would  be severely mistaken, as "The Luke Land" is just one of many stylish and highly technical executions coined from his extremely unique play.<br><br>

                    While he's been quiet during the online era as he focuses on other endeavours, such as <a href=https://open.spotify.com/track/2WkpqvvuiZmQX344NEnknI?si=cac5740bd1134805>his music</a>, he's still managed to rack himself up a good local resume early on in the season, including wins over Inky, NSFrog, clomz0, Drizzy, and LilMitts, earning him the #7 spot on the Atlantic PR. A pleasure to watch win or lose, keep your eyes out for any event his name pops up in.

                    Jack plays melee tournaments solely for the love of the game, and actually couldn’t care less about his results. This however, does not prevent him from being one of the strongest players in Atlantic Canada. While he doesn’t enter much, when he does he is a bracket menace. With winning records on OtES, NSFrog and LilMitts, he'll comfortably place #6 on this season's online rankings. It's clear to anyone who pays close attention that Jack could absolutely place higher and even be extremely competitive with anyone locally, if only he tried.

                    Some might think that Clomzo has outgrown his "coin-flip player" moniker, when in reality both his base and peak just keep growing. Once able to peak at 4th/5th best while also being able to lose to anyone, he's grown to a spot where even his worst losses aren't that bad, and at any time he could just be the best player in the room. Do not let his relaxed demeanor fool you, when he is playing hot Clomzo will rock you on the sticks. With the ability to be one of the fastest players in the region, Clomzo has wins on NSFrog and winning records on Jack, LilMitts and more. Keep a close eye on Clomzo in any bracket as his upset potential is very high.

                    Although Maher has been not as active during this season, he is still a threatening player when he is present in a tournament. Undefeated at local events in New Brunswick (Le Hub and Green Door Smash), he also boasts wins on NSFrog, clomz0 and Twan Jr. which shows that he is a very tough opponent. Maher's defensive and methodical approach to the game gained him a tournament win in the biggest and last event for this ranking period, and altogether that will net him the #4 spot on this PR.

                    Forged in the fire of COVID's slippi era, a new and galvanized Captain Falcon main "NSFrog" has taken the scene by storm. Entering a whopping 144 tournaments between the beginning of January 2021 and April 2022, its clear that he's been on a war path to take out anyone and everyone who he would lose to in the past; Geff, clomz0,  Drizzy, Kellz, Maher, and ACSL all having lost their most recent, if not last few sets to him.<br><br>


                    This, coupled with more and more great top global wins that include Siddward, Paladin, BBatts, Preeminent, JJM, Fro116, K8A, GWM, and mgmg, make Frog one of the players to watch closest going into the next season. While he's still had trouble defeating past bracket demons in Rick and Inky, if there's anything this past year should teach us it's that he's perfectly capable of doing it and rising from his new placement as #3 on the Atlantic PR to the very top.

                    The reigning #1 in Atlantic has had a rather quiet season, taking it mostly as an off season, playing League of Legends and Elden Ring, only entering here and there. Despite this he remains completely dominant over the region's finest, with one notable exception whom he has not played.<br><br>

                    While he hasn't been very active online he is looking to come back on LAN with a vengeance, but with a 97th placing at LACS4 and a win over Faust, Rick is certainly a potential threat at any major online or not.

                    Inky is an absolute demon in any bracket he plays in, as long as it has the prefix “winners”. An undefeated record vs the entire region when playing sheik, dropping only 5 games in total when playing his main. It doesn't matter who you are, Inky is a threat. With wins on Bab Activated, Bbatts and K8a nationally, and wins on every player ranked below 2nd locally, you cannot sleep on Inky.<br><br>

                    Coming into the summer of 2022, be on the lookout for a huge breakout performance from Inky as he certainly has the ability. The rivalry between the top two, who did not play a real set in over a year should also be the storyline to watch, as they have historically been extremely close, but could Inky run away with it from his recent grind? We’ll just have to wait and see.
